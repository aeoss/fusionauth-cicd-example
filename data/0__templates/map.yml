  # Setup Email Templates
  #
  # This configuration item allows you to create (and keep updated) email
  # templates for your FusionAuth instance. This can be useful for
  # version-controlled email templates.
  #
  # This is an array of objects with the following keys:
  #
  # id: The unique ID of this item in FusionAuth.
  # name: The name of the email template.
  # template: The directory where templates are located
  # (within /data/0__template/email)
  #
  # from:
  #   name: The default from name
  #   email: The default from email
  # subject: The subject of the email
  #
  # The template directory expects a `template.html` and `template.text`
  # file within the directory. These will be used for the HTML and text
  # email formats respectively.
  #
  # This is an optional configuration item. This does not currently
  # support localized email templates.
